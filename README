This is my model to work in an effective way with enumeration in C++.

It defines some macros which in automaticly work either with numeric value or
with the name of enumerations.

It will look similar to:

struct Transport {
   enum _v { None = -1, TCP, STCP, UDP };

   auto_enum_declare (Transport)
};

Some more lines and you will be able to write C++ like:

Transport::_v tt = Transport::UDP;


......


const char* name = Transport::getEnumName (Transport::STCP);

....

string nameEx = Transport::getEnumNameEx (tt);

...

Tranport::_v transport = Transport::getEnumValue ("UDP");

....
